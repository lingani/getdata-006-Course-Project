Coursera getdata-006 Project: repository for analysis R. script an code book that describes the the dataset
--------------------------------------------

This repository purpose is to provide:
  1. run_analysis.R: the R script file performed to get a tidy dataset as describle in the steps below and;
  2. code book.md: the code book that describes the tidy dataset

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

Here are the are the statements to create the run_analysis.R script:
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
